# Project 3

## Visulaization 1 - Map

To run:
```
1) Open the /map folder in a terminal
	1.5) If necessary (it shouldn't be, but just in case) run "sudo chmod run.sh +x"
2) Run "./run.sh" This creates a local HTTP server at localhost:5555
3) Nativage to localhost:5555/main.html
```

About:

This visualization shows the average number of tech items which can be described by a citizen of various countries. Hovering over a country will bring up a tooltip with the name of the country, the exact average number of definitions, and the number of entries for that country. The darker the country is colored, the higher the average number of tech items were able to be defined. The countries which are purley white are those which had an average of 0, and those which have NaN for the average value had no data available in the dataset. We chose to take this approach to our geographic visualizaion because it illuminates how relatively tech savvy different countries are. It is nice to have a visual map of this, because outliers in continents pop out very easily, such as Ethiopia and Kenya.


## Visualization 2

To run:
```
1) Open Anaconda Prompt (or equivalent program to run Jupyter notebooks)
2) Within said program, open the /Mean Score Vis folder 
3) Run the "Mean Score of Item Importance Visualization" Jupyter notebook.
```

About:

The second visualization shows a bar chart for each of the attributes from the question regarding purchasing a new tech device. The height of the bars reflect the mean score of that attribute given by the respondents of the survey. If you hover over any of the bars, the mean will be shown next to your cursor. We wanted to visualize which characteristics of a given a novel tech product were most important to consumers, especially those who're technologically apt. This is important to understand if you are a supplier since your success is determined by how well you are able to meet your consumers' needs. A bar chart is a simple visualization but quite effective for a comparison of a number of different attributes like this one. With a glance, you are able to interpret which of these characteristics are most important to this customer base.
