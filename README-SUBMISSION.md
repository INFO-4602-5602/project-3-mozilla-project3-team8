About:

This visualization shows the average number of tech items which can be described by a citizen of various countries. Hovering over a country will bring up a tooltip with the name of the country, the exact average number of definitions, and the number of entries for that country. The darker the country is colored, the higher the average number of tech items were able to be defined. The countries which are purley white are those which had an average of 0, and those which have NaN for the average value had no data available in the dataset. We chose to take this approach to our geographic visualizaion because it illuminates how relatively tech savvy different countries are. It is nice to have a visual map of this, because outliers in continents pop out very easily, such as Ethiopia and Kenya.
